#### 💡 Ideas

* Think about the weather. Do you want to use the light if it gets rainy/snowy/chilly/hot?
* What about your location? Want to trigger something when you leave a certain area at a certain time?
* Think about notifications you get on your phone. Would those be cool to light up the weird dog lamp thing?
* What about controlling your lights based on a text message?

#### 🖊 Correction

📓 I figured out what my problem was! After you change environment variables in Netlify you need to reboot. I decided to keep the bugs in there so you know that we all make mistakes, and how to debug a webhook. I hope you enjoy the lemonade made from the lemons of that bit 🍋.
